```c
LD X0.0    ; Load input X0.0
OUT Y0.0   ; Output to output Y0.0
```

This code demonstrates a simple ladder logic program that reads a signal from input X0.0 and outputs it to output Y0.0. When the input signal is on, the output signal will also turn on.

Note that this is just a simple example to illustrate the syntax of ladder logic in Omron PLC programming. In later lessons, we will cover more complex programs and how to use other instructions and functions.
